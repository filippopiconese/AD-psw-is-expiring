# Repository scope
In this repository I've stored various scripts useful for day to day tasks.

## Brief explanation of every folder
### AD OU Groups and members
This script retrieves information about AD groups within a specific OU. It retrieves a CSV file with the list of groups and a text file with the members of each group.
### AD Password is about to expire
This script helps the company to notify users when the AD password is about to expire.
### Create folders and assign groups with permissions
This script creates folders based on the information provided in a text file containing folder names and assigns advanced permissions to groups associated with these folders. Note that the group names in AD have been generated by combining a prefix with the folder name.
### Shared folder members analysis
This script is designed to retrieve the users who have access to folders within a specified share path and save the results to a text file.
