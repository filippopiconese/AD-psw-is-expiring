# Program objectives
This script creates folders based on the information provided in a text file containing folder names and assigns advanced permissions to groups associated with these folders. Note that the group names in AD have been generated by combining a prefix with the folder name.

## Program phases

### Variables

Set the needed variables:
- $filePath -> path to the text file containing folder names.
- $groupPrefix -> prefix used to generate group names based on folder names.
- $results -> array to store results and messages during folder creation and permission assignment.
- $destinationFolder -> path to the destination folder where new folders will be created.
- $outputFile -> path to the text file where results and messages will be saved.

### Functions

- N/A

### Execution

- It reads each line from the text file specified in $filePath.
- If a line matches the pattern indicating a folder under analysis, it extracts the folder name.
- It generates a group name and SAM account name based on the folder name by combining the prefix and folder name.
- It constructs the full path for the folder within the destination folder.
- It checks if the folder already exists; if not, creates the folder and logs the action.
- It retrieves the ACL (Access Control List) for the folder.
- It defines a list of permissions to be assigned to the group.
- It iterates through the permissions list and adds a corresponding access rule to the ACL.
- It sets the modified ACL for the folder.
- It logs the assignment of advanced permissions to the group for the folder.
- It outputs all results and messages to the specified output file.

### Output
The script generates a text file containing information about folder creation and permission assignments, including success messages and any existing folder notifications.
